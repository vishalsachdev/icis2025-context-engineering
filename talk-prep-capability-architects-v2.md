# Table Talk Facilitation Guide

## First Principles Critique of V1

Before using this guide, acknowledge what was wrong with the first draft:

| V1 Problem | Reality |
|------------|---------|
| Read like keynote prep | Table talks are conversations, not performances |
| 360 lines of "my evidence" | Other educators came to share THEIR challenges |
| All evidence from my own repos | That's a portfolio, not validation |
| "Excel is obsolete" soundbites | Dismissive of colleagues' legitimate work |
| Assumed everyone knows MCP | Most IS educators aren't AI practitioners |
| No counterarguments | Makes me look naive, not confident |
| Thesis presented as fact | It's a hypothesis I'm testing |

**The V1 document would have led me to lecture at people who came to collaborate.**

## What I Actually Want From This Session

Be honest:
- [ ] I want to learn what OTHER educators are trying
- [ ] I want to stress-test my thinking against skeptics
- [ ] I want to find collaborators, not converts
- [ ] I want to surface problems I haven't thought of
- [ ] I want to leave with better questions than I arrived with

## Opening (2 minutes max)

**The tension I'm wrestling with:**

> "I teach students to use tools—Python, SQL, Tableau. But I keep building things where the tool isn't the point. The point is defining WHAT the tool should do and WHY.
>
> I've started calling this 'capability architecture' but I don't know if that's the right frame. I'm not sure what to assess. I don't know how this fits accreditation. I don't know if I'm chasing hype.
>
> I called this table talk because I suspect others are wrestling with similar questions. I'd rather learn from you than present at you."

**Then shut up and ask the first question.**

## Discussion Questions (The Actual Session)

### Question 1: The Skill Stability Problem
**Context:** We teach students skills that have long shelf lives—accounting principles, statistical reasoning, communication. But technical tools change faster than curricula.

> "How do you decide what technical skills are worth teaching when the tools might be obsolete before students graduate?"

*Listen. Don't defend. Take notes on what others say.*

---

### Question 2: The Fundamentals Tension
**Context:** One counterargument to "teach higher-level thinking" is that students need fundamentals first. You can't architect systems if you don't understand how they work.

> "Do students need to master tools before they can design systems that use tools? Or is that a false prerequisite?"

*This is a genuine question I don't know the answer to.*

---

### Question 3: The Assessment Gap
**Context:** If we shift from "can you use Excel" to "can you define what good analysis looks like"—how do we grade that?

> "Has anyone found ways to assess 'design thinking' or 'systems thinking' that actually work? That aren't just rubrics we pretend to believe in?"

*I genuinely want to know. My current assessment approaches feel inadequate.*

---

### Question 4: The Hype Cycle Question
**Context:** Every few years there's a "this changes everything" moment in tech education. Learn to code. Data science. Now AI.

> "Is 'capability architecture' just another hype cycle? What would convince you it's different—or the same?"

*Steelman the skeptics. I might be wrong.*

---

### Question 5: The Employer Signal
**Context:** We claim to prepare students for employers. But do we actually know what employers want, or do we assume?

> "When you talk to employers about AI skills, what do they actually ask for? Is it different from what we're teaching?"

*I have anecdotes, not data. Others might have better signal.*

## If Conversation Stalls: Provocations

Only use these if discussion needs fuel. Don't force them.

**Provocation A:** "A consulting firm told me they care less about whether graduates can use AI and more about whether they can define what 'good work' looks like for AI to produce. Does that resonate?"

**Provocation B:** "I've been experimenting with having students write 'skill definitions' in plain English—like PRDs for AI behavior—instead of code. It's too early to know if it works. Is anyone else trying anything similar?"

**Provocation C:** "Karpathy and the Shopify CEO both use the term 'context engineering' over 'prompt engineering.' Is that a meaningful distinction or marketing?"

---

## What I'm Experimenting With (Only If Asked)

If someone asks "what are YOU doing about this?"—be humble:

> "I'm running experiments, not solutions. I've been building things like:
> - A Canvas LMS integration that lets AI access course data (canvas-mcp)
> - A library of reusable 'skills' that encode workflows (claude-skills)
> - A multi-agent system for entrepreneurship coaching (AgentLab)
>
> I don't know if any of this is the right approach. I'm learning in public. Happy to share the repos, but I'm more interested in what you're trying."

**Don't launch into a demo. Keep the focus on dialogue.**

## Honest Uncertainties

Things I should admit I don't know:

1. **Is "capability architecture" even a coherent concept?** I made up the term. It might not survive contact with rigor.

2. **Does this work for students who aren't technically inclined?** My experiments are with self-selected students who like building things.

3. **Am I just teaching Claude-specific skills?** MCP is Anthropic's protocol. What if OpenAI wins? Does the skill transfer?

4. **Is the "tools are obsolete" framing overblown?** Excel has been "dying" for 20 years. Maybe fundamentals matter more than I'm admitting.

5. **Do employers actually want this?** I have quotes from tech companies. Traditional employers might want something different entirely.

6. **Am I biased by my own enthusiasm?** I like building things. Maybe I'm projecting that preference onto curriculum design.

## Counterarguments I Should Take Seriously

If someone pushes back, don't get defensive. These are legitimate:

| Pushback | Honest Response |
|----------|-----------------|
| "Students need fundamentals first" | "You might be right. I don't have evidence that skipping fundamentals works." |
| "This is too technical for most business students" | "Fair. I might be designing for a narrow slice of students." |
| "Accreditation doesn't support this" | "True. I don't have a good answer for how this fits AACSB frameworks." |
| "You're just showcasing your GitHub" | "That's a fair critique. I don't have external validation." |
| "This will be obsolete in 2 years" | "Possibly. I'm betting on the abstraction level, not specific tools. But I could be wrong." |

## What I Want to Capture

During the session, note:
- [ ] Challenges others are facing (different from mine?)
- [ ] Approaches others are trying (what can I learn?)
- [ ] Counterarguments I hadn't considered
- [ ] Potential collaborators for future work
- [ ] Resources/papers others recommend

---

## Post-Session

- Share notes with participants
- Follow up with anyone who wants to continue the conversation
- Write a reflection: what changed in my thinking?

---

## The One Thing to Remember

**This is a table talk, not a TED talk.**

The goal isn't to convince anyone. The goal is to:
1. Surface a shared challenge
2. Learn from other educators
3. Stress-test my assumptions
4. Leave smarter than I arrived

If I spend more than 20% of the time talking, I'm doing it wrong.
