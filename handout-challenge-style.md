# Teaching Tech Differently
**Questions for IS Educators | ICIS 2025**

## A Frame I'm Testing

Every stage of business work—understanding, deciding, specifying—can now be AI-enabled.

The skill of working with AI at every stage is what people call **context engineering**—a term endorsed by [Tobi Lütke](https://x.com/tobi/status/1935533422589399127) (Shopify CEO) and [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1937902205765607626) (former Tesla AI Director, OpenAI founding member).

```
   UNDERSTAND  ──▶  DECIDE  ──▶  SPECIFY
       │              │             │
   AI helps       AI helps      AI helps
   analyze        evaluate      execute
```

**Business schools teach all three. What changes when each is AI-enabled?**

## Five Questions I'm Wrestling With

### 1. The Meta-Skill Question

If context engineering is "knowing what context to provide so AI can help effectively"—is that teachable? Or is it just experience?

> **How do we teach students to work WITH AI, not just use AI tools?**

---

### 2. The Staging Question

The three stages—understand, decide, specify—seem to build on each other.

> **Do students need to master earlier stages before AI-enabling them? Or can they learn all three together?**

---

### 3. The New Artifact Question

When Stage 3 produces a specification that AI executes (a "skill"), that's different from traditional requirements docs.

> **What does a "good" AI specification look like? How do we teach students to write them?**

---

### 4. The Assessment Question

We know how to assess understanding (exams), decisions (case analysis), and traditional specs (rubrics).

> **How do we assess the quality of context engineering? The quality of an AI specification?**

---

### 5. The Fundamentals Question

One view: AI augments fundamentals—you still need to understand problems and make decisions.

Another view: AI changes what "understanding" and "deciding" even mean.

> **Do the fundamentals stay the same, or does AI change them?**

---

## What I'm Experimenting With

I don't have solutions—I have experiments:

| Experiment | What I'm Testing |
|------------|------------------|
| **Claude Skills Library** | Can students write specifications AI executes? |
| **Canvas MCP** | Can students build infrastructure layers for AI? |
| **AgentLab** | Can students orchestrate multi-agent systems? |

These might be wrong directions. I'm learning.

## What I Don't Know

- Is "context engineering" teachable, or just a buzzword for experience?
- Does the three-stage model hold up, or is it too neat?
- Are Stage 1 and 2 prerequisites for Stage 3, or can students start anywhere?
- How do we grade "good context"?
- Am I just projecting my interests onto curriculum design?
