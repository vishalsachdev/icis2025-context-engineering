## Overview

This repository contains materials for a table talk exploring how AI changes what we teach in business schools. The core argument:

**Every stage of business work—understanding, deciding, specifying—can now be AI-enabled. The meta-skill across all three is *context engineering*.**

The term "context engineering" was endorsed by [Tobi Lütke](https://x.com/tobi/status/1935533422589399127) (Shopify CEO) and [Andrej Karpathy](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1937902205765607626) (former Tesla AI Director, OpenAI founding member) in mid-2025.

## The Framework

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   CONTEXT ENGINEERING                       │
│        (How you work WITH AI at every stage)                │
│                                                             │
│   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐      │
│   │ UNDERSTAND  │──▶│   DECIDE    │──▶│   SPECIFY   │      │
│   │  AI helps   │   │  AI helps   │   │  AI helps   │      │
│   │  analyze    │   │  evaluate   │   │  execute    │      │
│   └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Business schools already teach understanding, decision-making, and specification. What's new:
- All three stages can be AI-enabled
- The output of Stage 3 might be a specification AI itself executes (a "skill")
- Context engineering is the meta-skill across all three
