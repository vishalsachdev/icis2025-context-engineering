## Detailed Flow

### 3:30 — Opening (3 min)

**Core frame (see `CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK.md` for full model)**

Say something like:

> "I've been thinking about how AI changes what we teach. Not replacing business fundamentals—but adding a new layer.
>
> Every stage of business work—understanding problems, deciding on solutions, specifying requirements—can now be AI-enabled. The skill of working with AI at every stage is what people are calling **context engineering**.
>
> There's also a new artifact: when we specify requirements, sometimes those specifications are FOR AI to execute—not just docs for humans.
>
> I'm not sure I have the right frame yet. I called this table talk because I suspect others are wrestling with similar questions. Let's start with a question."

**Then immediately move to the warm-up. Don't lecture.**

---

### 3:33 — Warm-up Question (5 min)

**Goal:** Get voices in the room early. Break the "audience" dynamic.

Ask:

> "Quick round: What's ONE technical skill you teach that you're not sure will matter in 5 years?"

Go around the table. Keep it to 20-30 seconds each. Just listen and nod.

**Facilitator notes:**
- Don't respond to each answer
- Don't judge or correct
- Just collect and thank

---

### 3:38 — Exercise Setup (2 min)

**Distribute `handout-fraud-detection-exercise.md`**

Say:

> "Let's try something. I want to put you in your students' shoes—in a domain where you're NOT the expert.
>
> You've been hired by an insurance company to design an AI capability that flags potentially fraudulent claims. You're not a claims adjuster. You've never processed a claim.
>
> Your job is to define what 'suspicious' looks like—well enough for AI to help, but knowing when to hand off to humans.
>
> Work with the person next to you. You have 5 minutes. Fill in what you can. Mark what you're uncertain about."

---

### 3:40 — Exercise Part 1 (5 min)

**Let them work. Walk around. Listen. Don't help too much.**

If groups are stuck, prompt:
- "What would make YOU suspicious if you were reviewing claims?"
- "What's the first thing you'd want to know?"
- "What should the AI definitely NOT decide on its own?"

**Watch the clock.**

---

### 3:45 — The Twist (1 min)

Interrupt the room:

> "Stop for a moment. News from Legal."
>
> "The AI cannot use zip code, neighborhood, or demographic proxies as fraud indicators—due to fair lending and discrimination concerns."
>
> "You have 4 more minutes. Adapt your design."

---

### 3:46 — Exercise Part 2 (4 min)

Let them wrestle with the constraint. This is where the real learning happens.

---

### 3:50 — Debrief (8 min)

Bring the room back together. Ask:

1. **"How did you define 'suspicious' without being a fraud expert?"**
   - Let 2-3 groups share briefly
   - Note different approaches

2. **"What was harder: the domain gap or the ethical constraint?"**
   - This usually sparks good discussion

3. **"How did the mid-task change affect your design?"**
   - Connect to: "This happens constantly in real projects"

4. **Land the point (THE NEW FRAMING):**
   > "Notice what you just did. You worked through three stages:
   >
   > **Understand** — You tried to grasp a problem you're not expert in. In a real scenario, you might have AI help you research fraud patterns.
   >
   > **Decide** — You chose what should be flagged vs. escalated. AI could help you evaluate different detection approaches.
   >
   > **Specify** — You wrote it down in a format AI could execute.
   >
   > At every stage, you were doing **context engineering**—figuring out what information matters, how to structure it, what to include and exclude.
   >
   > Business schools already teach stages 1 and 2. What might be new is that all three stages can be AI-enabled, and the output of stage 3 might be a specification that AI itself executes. That's the shift I'm wrestling with."

---

### 3:58 — Open Discussion (15 min)

**This is the heart of a table talk. Let them drive.**

Seed questions (use only if needed):

From `talk-prep-capability-architects-v2.md`:

- "If AI can write code, what should we assess?"
- "Do students need to master tools before they can design systems?"
- "Has anyone found ways to assess 'systems thinking' that actually work?"
- "When you talk to employers about AI skills, what do they actually ask for?"

**Your job:**
- Ask follow-up questions
- Connect threads between speakers
- Take notes on what you're learning
- Resist the urge to answer everything

---

### 4:13 — Synthesis (5 min)

Reflect back what you heard:

> "Let me try to synthesize what I'm hearing..."

Name 2-3 themes that emerged. Ask if you got it right.

Then ask:

> "What's one thing you might try differently in your own teaching after today?"

Quick round—30 seconds each.

---

### 4:18 — Close (2 min)

> "Thank you for thinking with me. I learned [specific thing] from this conversation.
>
> I'll share notes from this session with anyone who wants them. There's a space on the handout for your email.
>
> My contact info is on both handouts. I'm genuinely interested in what you're trying—reach out anytime."

**If you haven't distributed `handout-challenge-style.md`, do it now.**

## If Things Go Wrong

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **Nobody's talking** | Go to the exercise earlier. Doing beats discussing. |
| **One person dominates** | "That's a great point. Let's hear from someone who hasn't spoken yet." |
| **Exercise is too hard** | "What would you need to know? Let's list the questions, not the answers." |
| **Running out of time** | Skip synthesis, go straight to close. The exercise IS the value. |
| **Running long** | Table talks often go over. That's fine if people are engaged. |
| **Someone is skeptical/hostile** | "That's a fair challenge. What would change your mind?" (Don't defend.) |

## The One Rule

**If you're talking more than 30% of the time, something's wrong.**

This is a table talk, not a TED talk. Your job is to facilitate, not perform.

*Good luck Monday. You've got this.*
